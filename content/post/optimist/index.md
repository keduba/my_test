I read a poem recently. It was titled Richard Cory, written by Edwin Arlington Robinson. It seemed to me like something I'd read a long time ago but on a chance mention by a friend I read it again. Going through it reminded me of a story by one of my favourite writers, G.K. Chesterton. Contained in the collection of short stories called **The Innocence of Father Brown**, the story titled "Three Tools of Death" was about a man, an incurable optimist, that committed suicide.

Some weeks ago, two of my classmates came back from a walk and recounted to me how they saw a girl held back from breaking more than just her bones on a pavement three floors below her window. Some person or persons struggled to pull her in from the narrow ledge up above and stayed with her in the house until the police came and took her. Stories like this are sad, and part of what makes them sad is that sometimes when people take their lives they write notes asking their friends and family to understand but what if they shared their troubles with others while there was still something that could have been done to help? Before jumping or shooting or overdosing, the general assumption is that no one will understand, yet a note is written asking for understanding. What if that understanding was actively sought while alive, while it could have been useful?

So who is the incurable or the eternal optimist? Briefly speaking, this refers to that class of people who always affect to be happy and bouyant and upbeat *all the time*. It is good to be all of those, and sometimes it can be good also to make ourselves feel happy even when we don't want to. But the problem of the incurable optimist lies in the refusal to acknowledge to themselves or to others when things are not going well. This kind of optimist chooses to affect a cheerful fa√ßade all the time without ever admitting weakness, sadness or fallibility. This extreme desire to show only a strong, positive side all the time leads them to bottle up emotional turbulence that ordinarily should be let out. The Wikipedia article [Optimism bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimism_bias) sounds like this.

One of the problems with the eternal optimist is the insistence on showing the world only one side of themselves, only a cheerful side. To everyone he wants to be known as one who sees the cup as half full, as rosy all the time. He is probably afflicted by the idea that some motivational speakers peddle who prefer to paint a rose-coloured world. But even a blind person can see that some days are blue, some are grey and there are days that don't even have colour. When we accept things they way they are, our attitude towards things we cannot control changes. We get to look at them with a smile.

Generally the macho attitude gives the answer to the question, "How are you doing?" as "I am fine" even when they aren't. Yet it is completely okay to not be okay and to also be able to say, "I'm not feeling so good" or "I feel a bit uneasy." That is being alive. We should be wary of a life that is either endlessly bright or endlessly dark. A life without disappointments is neither interesting nor desirable. We need disappointments to shake us up from lethargy or complacence. We need failures to teach us humility. We need heartbreaks sometimes to show us not only our weaknesses but also our strengths. To deny these seeming 'evils' is to shut the door on the opportunities that they will bring us for sincerity in our friendships, warmth in our relationships, personal growth, and the ability to actually see and hear others.

The perpetual optimist sees what he wants to see, or rather what he has pre-defined himself to see. In the same way too he hears what he wants to hear no matter what or how it is said. Like this, there is the tendency to miss out on non-verbal cues and then clearly misconstrue the verbal ones. Talking with someone like this is like talking through a filter. What gets through is what he wants not what you want.

There are a number of things that they might be trying to escape from. It could be that this is how they have learnt to deal with disappointments, sadness, depression, despair or failure whether real or imagined. Using this heavy sense of optimism to cloak it seems like an obvious way to make it disappear but it's only a Houdini's elephant. You can't see it but it's still in the room.

Disappointment is Providence's way of reminding us that we are not alone, of telling us to unburden ourselves, to bring our estimations of things and of ourselves into the right order. Self-honesty enables us to admit that things are not to us as we thought them, that we sometimes need to adjust our perspectives a bit so as to see better and evaluate our situations more objectively. One might not be honest to other people but self-denial is one of the first steps on the stairs to the top from which people plunge head down, nudged over the edge by any of paranoia, depression, psychosis, neurosis or mental stress. Many suicides (*if not all*) are as a result of little thoughts that were not accepted for what they were until they assumed gargantuan proportions that spiralled out of control. From asking "how could I have done this?", they end up at "I can't take this anymore."

Another thing you will notice with them is that their work suffers. They get passed over for promotions. They don't catch or seize on the hints that will get them through the right doors. Why? They have their own version of the world that they want to live in and it affects how they interact with colleagues at work, with friends at social gatherings and so on. They want to be the nice guy, the nice girl when their colleagues or friends only want a guy or a girl. Folks want people with their feet solidly on the ground or as close to solid as possible. If you were an incurable optimist, start with having your feet on the ground. When you have it then others can open up to you and can give you feedback because they know it won't be wasted. They know they can have real conversations with you without needing to treat you like a child that needs parenting.

All you need is to open your mouth and speak. Speak to one who will listen. There is at least one person in six who will not only listen but will also have a few helpful words that will clear up the storm. To be honest, I wouldn't be writing this, if I did not learn to talk to people and to trust that there were those who not only loved and cared about me, but were able to sympathise with whatever I was feeling. At any rate, if you ever feel that no one will get you, stop being stuck up and telling yourself that no one will understand you because there are people who understand even Astrophysics.

To be able to understand and measure success, we should also be able to measure failure. The *idiots* selling the *get-rich-tomorrow-morning* schemes might make failure or feeling down uncool, but tell me, what is an up without a down? So if you're feeling out of sorts, and someone asks you, "What's up?" have the courage to say, "Something is tugging at my mind, something is nagging at me." To be a superman, you have to be a real man or woman first.

Having come this far, one of the things you will notice that being a normalist means being more human. You'll be able to connect with people beyond the surface. You will see them, you will notice the colour of their eyes, the rouge in their cheeks, the gap in their teeth when they smile, and the way their eyes squeeze when they are confused. You will notice those whose voices are like music and those whose voices grate on the ear. You will know who you can trust and who you shouldn't. You will feel empathy for people suffering because you have also suffered yourself -- even if it's from excessive optimism. By admitting when things are not okay or that they aren't, you will be showing that you can feel pain like everyone else. It shows also that you are willing to learn and be better. You will be showing others that they are welcome to fill you up where you have gaps and that you will also do same for them.

On a hunch, I'm betting that the eternal optimist does not really laugh. He might make the sound of laughter, of course, sometimes even more than others. But it's just the sound and doesn't ring true. Laughter is our way of expressing wonder and delight at things. Real warm laughter is contagious and helps us to connect with people. You can get hot just from laughing.

So let down your hair, put your feet up and let the breeze blow over you. Maybe after reading through this, you say, "Naaa! I don't want to leave my optimism. People know me as an optimist." Well well, one more question for you. "When you turn off the lights at night do you remain an optimist?" If you don't deal with this excessive optimism, the most people are going to say is, "But she always *seemed* so happy," or "He was always smiling."

To close for now, optimism is like salt. A healthy dose is a tiny dose taken in sprinkles, a touch here and there. Anything more than that, and the food becomes outright inedible. It will be preserved but no one will eat it. Therefore if letting go of your optimism means allowing yourself to express your anger, express it. Then learn how to control and channel that anger. It is a better skill to learn how to be angry and direct it than to be always smiling even when there is nothing to smile about because anger moves us to action that placidity does not. Better angry and active than an immobile optimist.
